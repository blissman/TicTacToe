# Tic-Tac-Toe (Raccoon and Cat Edition)

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple web game built with Javascript and JQuery. Cartoon
raccoons and cats replace the more traditional X's and O's, and game logic is
performed with magic square sums.

Click on the square to choose it, or use the keyboard! Squares correspond to
QWE, ASD, ZXC respectively.
